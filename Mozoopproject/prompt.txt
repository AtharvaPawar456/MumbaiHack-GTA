make a emptry list : trimList = []
based on dataJson trim multiple clips from the video : "ff.mp4" as trim<1,2 ,3 ,4 ...>.mp4 and save it
then track every appeand the trim file name
then join all the files mentioned in the trimList and make a full video file and save it

give me proper python code for it


audioList = ["song1.mp3","song2.mp3", "song3.mp3","song4.mp3", "song5.mp3", "song6.mp3", "song6.mp3"]
